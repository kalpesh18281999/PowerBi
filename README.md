## ðŸš€ Turning Data into Insights ðŸš€

I am thrilled to share my Power BI dashboard created for the  #codebasicsresumeprojectchallenge by CodeBasics. This project focused on Supply Chain Analytics for a FMCG manufacturer, analyzing critical KPIs to improve service levels and customer satisfaction.

ðŸ”¹Project Overview:
The dataset provided by the CodeBasics team required us to track and analyze five main KPIs:

OT % - On Time Delivery Percentage.

IF % - In Full Delivery Percentage

OTIF % - On Time and In Full Delivery Percentage

LIFR - Line Fill Rate

VOFR - Volume Fill Rate

ðŸ”¹Problem Statement:
Due to service issues, key customers have not renewed their annual contracts. The management wants to monitor the "On-Time" and "In-Full" delivery service levels daily to improve these metrics and eventually expand the business to new cities.

ðŸ”¹Task:
As a data analyst, I developed a dashboard to track these metrics, derive valuable insights, and assist the supply chain team in retaining customers and expanding the business.

ðŸ”¹Additional Metrics Measured:
Customer Order Cycle Time (COCT)
Delay in delivery from the agreed delivery day

ðŸ”¹Key Learning and Features:
Gained domain knowledge in supply chain management.
Designed an interactive dashboard with bookmarks, advanced visual formatting, and features.
Developed complex DAX measures for visuals and conditional formatting.
Implemented buttons and hover effects for enhanced visual interaction.
Created a slicer panel with open/close buttons and displayed selected data filters on the page.
ðŸ”¹ Tools Used: Microsoft Power BI, DAX Studio

This challenge was a fantastic opportunity to deepen my understanding of supply chain analytics, master complex DAX functions, and improve my dashboard design skills.

ðŸŒŸ Special Thanks To:
Dhaval Patel & Hemanand Vadivel for organizing this challenge.
Federico Pastor & Bas Dohmen for their guidance on advanced formatting options.
